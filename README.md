# Landing Page Project

This project is a part of Front End Developer Nanodegree program by Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster and Udacity. The project aims learners to practice manipulating the DOM through real-world scenario by building a multi-section landing page.

Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which learners will experience when they begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.

This landing page project presents the opportunity to fully combine skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying skills with these three technologies, learners will discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

## Demo

You can see the [project demo](https://sirilaktem.github.io/udacity-landing-page-project) without downloading any source files.

## Installation

Installation is not required. The project can be cloned and run on any modern web browsers.

## Development

This project requires learners to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The starter code of this project is provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page), but I decided to develop this project on my own by using the free design from [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/). All the assets like images, logos, icons, etc are from Untitled UI.
