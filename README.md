## Development

The starter code of this project is provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page), but I decided to develop this project on my own by using the free design from [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/). All the assets like images, logos, icons, etc are from Untitled UI.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Some third-party assets are included as follow:

-   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
