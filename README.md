# Installation

Installation is not required. The project can be cloned and run on any modern web browsers.

# Usage

Users can navigate through each section of the landing page using top navigation. Once clicking on any menus, the page will scroll smoothly to the related section. To go back to the hero section, users have to click on the logo on top navigation or clicking the scroll to top arrow button at the bottom right of the screen.

If users scroll the landing page, the menus on top navigation will be highlight automatically to show users which section they're seeing on the screen. And the active sections will show animation background as well.

# Development

The starter code of this project is provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page), but I decided to develop this project on my own by using the free design from [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/). All the assets like images, logos, icons, etc are from Untitled UI.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Some third-party assets are included as follow:

-   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
